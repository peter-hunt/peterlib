# PeterLib

A common framework library for Python functions like Computer Algebra System (CAS), CLI engine for CLI interface and RPG, RPG profile manager template, Pydantic/dataclass styled data type base class for easier data management and JSON loading/dumping, and future contents to come.

## Usage

The code in the project is not organized to be executed directly. There are some that require dependency libraries listed in the `requirements.txt`. Example usages might be added in the future.

## Current content

- `algebra.py`: Python CAS system.
- `cliengine.py`: CLI engine for CLI interface and RPG.
- `datatype.py`: Pydantic/dataclass styled data type base class for easier data management and JSON loading/dumping.
- `profile_manage.py` and `profile_template`: profile manager with working folder management with `saves` and `settings.json`. The profile class template is for functionality integration with the management code.
